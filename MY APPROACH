MY APPROACH 
 to add task 
    add an event listener that prevent the form from reloading when submit is click
    add a function that create a new element - list. and equate the value to the value of the input 
    the element should also include the buttons- edit % delete
    append the result into the ul element to reflect changes
to remove task 
    add an event that listen to click on the button 
    it should check contains a class name 'delete"
    then select the parent node
    use the removeNode function to remove the parent 
 // try to use a confirmation
 to edit task
    add an event that list to when a edit button is click
    a fucntion that change the task-text field to an diff node
    the node should contain a new div with input and mark button
    when the use clcik on mark
    it should remove the div and return the array
    
    ....
    a fucntion that replace the text content to the current input
    it should render output with the current input text
    a new event listen is call to equate the text with the current input
